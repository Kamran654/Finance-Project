9. ## insights
10. 66% of products are expired, indicating a major issue with inventory turnover and lifecycle
  tracking.
Stock levels of expired products are consistently high (~65,000) over time, suggesting 
 that old inventory isn’t being liquidated effectively
The number of non-expired products (~37,000) is consistently lower than expired ones, 
 risking product availability and lost sales on current-demand items.
Stock levels are almost evenly distributed across product ratings,
 with low-rated (1 and 2 stars) items making up 40% of inventory.
Most product categories have a fairly balanced stock distribution across 
1–3 years warranty periods, with Smartphones showing a spike (9.21%) at 3 years.
